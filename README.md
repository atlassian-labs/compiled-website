## FAQ

### Why is this not in the monorepo?

This site is written with Compiled.
We want to make sure the consumption story works,
completely,
with no impacts from the monorepo.

### Why is the landing page and docs separate apps?

Previously we had the the landing page be a TypeScript build,
and the docs be a Babel build.
We haven't done the work to consolidate them yet since we've standardized on Babel.
