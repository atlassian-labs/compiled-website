# Styled

Use `styled` when wanting to create a component that has styles tied to an element which comes with built-in behaviour such as `ref` and `as` prop support.

<StyledString />

## Dynamic declarations

Dynamic declarations are powered by [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).
Any props that are valid HTML attributes will be passed down to the underlying DOM node -
otherwise they will be ignored.

This example shows this behavior -
if you inspect the example element in dev tools you'll see the `primary` prop has not been passed through.

<StyledDynamic />

> **Remember** - It's all done at build time.
> No cost is paid at runtime to check if the prop is a valid HTML attribute.

### Transient props

When wanting to use a prop name that is also a valid HTML attribute and don't want it to appear on the element,
prefix the prop with `$` and it won't be applied.

This example shows that `color` is passed down to the DOM element,
but `$color` is not.

<StyledTransientProps />

## The as prop

The `as` prop is useful when wanting to change the markup during runtime to something else,
such as from a `<h1>` element to a `<span>`.

<StyledAsProp />

## Composing components

Wrapping an already defined component enables you to pass styles to it.
The composing components styles will take precedence over the composed components styles,
assuming they're both styled with Compiled.

<StyledComposition />

> **Note** - Ensure the wrapped component sets its `className` and `style` props otherwise the styles will not be applied.

## TypeScript

Type support comes out of the box so you'll have a great time using Compiled with TypeScript,
any interpolation will have access to the props defined in the tagged template generic.

```jsx
import { styled } from '@compiled/react';

const BigIfTrue = styled.div<{ big: true }>`
  font-size: ${props => big ? 100 : 10};
`;

<BigIfTrue />
 ^^^^^^^^^ Property 'big' is missing in type [..]
```

> **Note** - Typing of composed components are inherited,
> which means their props will be available as props as well.
