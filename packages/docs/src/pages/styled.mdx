# Styled

Use `styled` to create a component that has styles tied to an element which comes with built-in behavior such as `ref` and `as` prop support.

<StyledString />

## Dynamic declarations

Change a [CSS declaration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/How_CSS_is_structured#Properties_and_values) at runtime,
powered by [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).

Any props that are valid HTML attributes will be passed down to the underlying DOM element -
otherwise they will be ignored.

This example shows that behavior -
inspect the example using dev tools and you'll see the `primary` prop has not been passed through.

<StyledDynamic />

> **Remember** <br /> Styles are all pre-calculated at build time,
> no cost is paid at runtime to check if the prop is a valid HTML attribute.

### Transient props

Use a prop name prefixed with `$` and even if it's a valid HTML attribute it won't be passed down to the DOM element.

This example shows that `color` is passed down to the DOM element,
but `$color` is not.

<StyledTransientProps />

## The as prop

The `as` prop is useful when wanting to change the markup during runtime to something else,
such as from a `<h1>` element to a `<span>`.

<StyledAsProp />

## Composing components

Wrapping an already defined component enables you to pass styles to it.
Here the `BlueText` styles take presedence over `RedText`.

<StyledComposition />

> **Note** <br /> When composing custom componens make sure to set its `className` and `style` props otherwise styles will not be applied correctly.

## TypeScript

Type support comes out of the box so you'll have a great time using Compiled with TypeScript,
any interpolation will have access to the props defined in the tagged template generic.

```jsx
import { styled } from '@compiled/react';

const BigIfTrue = styled.div<{ big: true }>`
  font-size: ${props => big ? 100 : 10};
`;

<BigIfTrue />
 ^^^^^^^^^ Property 'big' is missing in type [..]
```

> **Note** <br /> Typing of composed components are inherited,
> which means their props will be available as props as well.
