# ClassNames

Use `ClassNames` to have more control over a component that has styles not necessarily tied to an element,
enabling powerful patterns with [render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html).

<ClassNamesObj />

## Dynamic declarations

Change a [CSS declaration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/How_CSS_is_structured#Properties_and_values) at runtime,
powered by [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).
Make sure to set the `style` prop.

<ClassNamesDynamic />

## Composing styles

Composing styles through props allows your consumers to add and override styles.
Make sure to pass through `className` and `style`.

<ClassNamesComposition />
