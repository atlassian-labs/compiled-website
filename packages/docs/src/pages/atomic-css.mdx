# Atomic CSS

Compiled uses atomic CSS as the delivery mechanism for your styles.
However when writing your CSS-in-JS you won't even notice that it does!

This page goes over what behaviors are possible using atomic CSS.
If you're just getting started don't feel the need to read this page,
but if you're interested in understanding more under the hood,
keep on reading.

## Reducing defined styles

Styles delivered as atomic rules reduces the total amount defined by creating a single rule for every declaration â€”
enabling large re-use.

```css
.button {
  border: none;
  font-size: 14px;
  background-color: purple;
  border-radius: 3px;
}
```

```html
<button className="button">Hello world</button>
```

This rule transformed to atomic CSS looks like:

```css
.b-none {
  border: none;
}

.fs-14 {
  font-size: 14px;
}

.bgc-purple {
  background-color: purple;
}

.br-3 {
  border-radius: 3px;
}
```

```html
<button className="b-none fs-14 bgc-purple br-3">Hello world</button>
```

When other components define the same styles they use the same rules.

```html
<span className="fs-14">Text</span>
```

As your product grows less often new CSS rules need to be created.

## Overriding through composition

When you can't create CSS at runtime enabling [composition of styles](/composition) can seem impossible.
If nothing was done depending on the order of rendered components you'd get different results.

Using atomic CSS we can encode all the data needed to ensure developers can compose styles together,
without the gotchas of [CSS cascade ordering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance).

Take these two atomic rules:

```css
.color-blue {
  color: blue;
}
.color-red {
  color: red;
}
```

There are two pieces of data that can be used in the class name.

1. The atomic group - in this case `color`
1. The atomic value - in this case `blue` and `red`

> **Group structure** <br /> Atomic groups also include selectors and at rules.
> The structure of a group is `hash({atrules}{selectors}{propertyname})`.

Using this data we can ensure that only one atomic group can exist in an elements class name,
using a small utility called `ax`.

```jsx
<div className={ax(['color-blue', 'color-red'])} />
```

When executed only `color-red` remains.

```jsx
<div className="color-red" />
```

The last atomic group defined wins.

## Automatic pseudo class ordering

When defining [pseudo classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) atomic CSS imposes some restrictions.
Remember,
only one CSS rule per declaration can exist!

Take these two examples which order `hover` and `active` pseudo classes differently,
but they share the same atomic rule,
what happens?

```jsx
<div
  css={`
    :hover {
      color: blue;
    }
    :active {
      color: red;
    }
  `}
/>
```

```jsx
<div
  css={`
    :active {
      color: red;
    }
    :hover {
      color: blue;
    }
  `}
/>
```

The simple answer is it depends which component renders first!
To ensure we have a stable experience automatic ordering of common pseudo classes is done.

- **L**ink
- **V**isited
- **F**ocus within
- **F**ocus
- **F**ocus visible
- **H**over
- **A**ctive

The last defined pseudo wins.
For the list above,
active state would take precedence over hover state.
This ordering ensures a stable,
consistent experience.

## Trade-offs

### Larger class names

Styles delivered as atomic CSS increases HTML markup by the addition of classes to elements.
Every CSS declaration will add a class to the element,
scaling linearly,
with compression techniques like `gzip` working very well at keeping your bundle size small.

We have [optimization ideas](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/335) to investigate for compressing class names.

### Selector specificity

Styles delivered with atomic CSS share the same [specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity),
so its up to their order in the style sheet to determine what takes presedence over the other.
Compiled handles common [pseudo class ordering](#ordered-pseudos) for you,
however other pseudo selectors including media queries may unexpectedly clash.

At those times an easy option could be to double the specificity using the [nesting selector](/writing-css#nesting-selector),
however re-writing your styles so only a single declaration can take affect at once may prove more fruitful.
