# Atomic CSS

Compiled uses atomic CSS as the delivery mechanism for your styles.
However when writing your CSS-in-JS you won't even notice that it does!


This page goes over what behaviors are possible using atomic CSS.
If you're just getting started don't feel the need to read this page,
but if you're interested in understanding more under the hood,
keep on reading.

## Reducing defined CSS

CSS delivered as atomic rules reduces the total amount of defined CSS by creating a single rule for every declaration —
enabling large re-use of styles.

```css
.button {
  border: none;
  font-size: 14px;
  background-color: purple;
  border-radius: 3px;
}
```

```html
<button className="button">Hello world</button>
```

This rule transformed to atomic CSS looks like:

```css
.b-none {
  border: none;
}

.fs-14 {
  font-size: 14px;
}

.bgc-purple {
  background-color: purple;
}

.br-3 {
  border-radius: 3px;
}
```

```html
<button className="b-none fs-14 bgc-purple br-3">Hello world</button>
```

When other components end up defining the same styles they use the same rules.

```html
<span className="fs-14">Text</span>
```

Thus as your product grows the less often new CSS rules need to be created.

## Overriding through composition

When you can't create CSS at runtime enabling [composition of styles](/composition) can seem impossible.
If nothing was done depending on the order of rendered components you'd get different results.

Using atomic CSS we can encode all the data needed to ensure developers can compose styles together,
without the gotchas of [CSS cascade ordering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance).

Take these two atomic rules:

```css
.color-blue {
  color: blue;
}
.color-red {
  color: red;
}
```

There are two pieces of data that can be used in the class name.

1. The atomic group - in this case `color`
1. The atomic value - in this case `blue` and `red`

> **Note** <br /> Atomic groups also include selectors and at rules.
> The structure of a group is `hash({atrules}{selectors}{propertyname})`.

Using this data we can ensure that only one atomic group can exist in an elements class name,
using a small utility called `ax`.

```jsx
<div className={ax(['color-blue', 'color-red'])} />
```

When executed only `color-red` remains.

```jsx
<div className="color-red" />
```

The last atomic group defined wins.

## Ordered pseudos

When defining pseudo classes atomic CSS imposes some restrictions.
Remember,
only one CSS rule per declaration can exist!

Take these two examples which order `hover` and `active` pseudo classes differently,
but they share the same atomic rule,
what happens?

```jsx
<div
  css={`
    :hover {
      color: blue;
    }
    :active {
      color: red;
    }
  `}
/>
```

```jsx
<div
  css={`
    :active {
      color: red;
    }
    :hover {
      color: blue;
    }
  `}
/>
```

The simple answer is it depends which component renders first!
Which is inconsistent at best,
and just plain wrong at worse.

To ensure we have a stable experience enforcement of a specific ordering of pseudo classes is done using **LVFHA**:

- **L**ink
- **V**isited
- **F**ocus
- **H**over
- **A**ctive

The last defined pseudo wins.
For the list above,
active state would take precedence over hover state.
This ordering ensures a stable,
consistent experience.

## Drawbacks

There are trade-offs for everything.
Atomic CSS while dramatically reducing the total amount of defined CSS,
increases HTML markup from the addition of added classes to elements.

Every CSS declaration will add another class to the element,
scaling linearly.
At scale this can prove to be worth it,
with compression techniques like `gzip` working very well at keeping your bundle size small.

We have some [optimization ideas to investigate](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/335) when we are further through development.
