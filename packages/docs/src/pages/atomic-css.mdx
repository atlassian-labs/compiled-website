# Atomic CSS

Compiled outputs your styles as atomic CSS.
This page goes over what it is and what behaviors are enabled by using it.
If you're just getting started don't feel the need to read this page,
but if you're interested in understanding more under-the-hood keep on reading.

## What is it

Atomic CSS is a method of reducing the total amount of defined rules by creating a single rule for every declaration â€”
enabling large style re-use.

Take a regular looking style rule:

```css
.button {
  border: none;
  font-size: 14px;
  background-color: purple;
  border-radius: 3px;
}
```

```html
<button className="button">Hello world</button>
```

Transformed to atomic CSS every declaration is now a rule:

```css
.b-none {
  border: none;
}

.fs-14 {
  font-size: 14px;
}

.bgc-purple {
  background-color: purple;
}

.br-3 {
  border-radius: 3px;
}
```

```html
<button className="b-none fs-14 bgc-purple br-3">Hello world</button>
```

When other components define the same styles they use the same rules.
As your styles grow rules are created less often.

## Overriding through composition

Compiled [can't create CSS at runtime](/limitations) and because of this [composition of styles](/composition) may seem out of reach.

Using atomic CSS we can encode all the data needed to ensure developers can compose styles together without the gotchas of [CSS cascade ordering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance).

Take these two atomic rules:

```css
.color-blue {
  color: blue;
}

.color-red {
  color: red;
}
```

There are two pieces of data that can be used in the class name.

1. The atomic group - in this case `color`
1. The atomic value - in this case `blue` and `red`

> **Group structure** <br /> Atomic groups also include selectors and at rules,
> the structure of an actual atomic group in Compiled is `hash({atrules}{selectors}{propertyname})`.

Using this data and a small utility called `ax` we ensure that only one atomic group can exist in an elements class name,

```jsx
<div className={ax(['color-blue', 'color-red'])} />
// <div class="color-red" />
```

The last atomic group defined wins.

## Automatic pseudo class ordering

When defining [pseudo classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) atomic CSS imposes some restrictions.
Remember,
only one CSS rule per declaration can exist!

Take these two examples which order `hover` and `active` pseudo classes differently,
but they share the same atomic rule,
what happens?

```jsx
<div
  css={css`
    :hover {
      color: blue;
    }
    :active {
      color: red;
    }
  `}
/>
```

```jsx
<div
  css={css`
    :active {
      color: red;
    }
    :hover {
      color: blue;
    }
  `}
/>
```

The simple answer is it depends which component renders first!
To ensure we have a stable experience automatic ordering of common pseudo classes is done.

- **L**ink
- **V**isited
- **F**ocus within
- **F**ocus
- **F**ocus visible
- **H**over
- **A**ctive

The last defined pseudo wins.
For the list above,
active state would take precedence over hover state.
This ordering ensures a stable,
consistent experience.

## Trade-offs

### Larger class names

Styles delivered as atomic CSS increases HTML markup by the addition of classes to elements.
Every CSS declaration will add a class to the element,
scaling linearly,
with compression techniques like `gzip` working very well at keeping your bundle size small.

We have [optimization ideas](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/335) to investigate for compressing class names.

### Selector specificity

Styles delivered with atomic CSS share the same [specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity),
so its up to their order in the style sheet to determine what takes presedence over the other.
Compiled handles common [pseudo class ordering](#ordered-pseudos) for you,
however other pseudo selectors including media queries may unexpectedly clash.

At those times an easy option could be to double the specificity using the [nesting selector](/writing-css#nesting-selector),
however re-writing your styles so only a single declaration can take affect at once may prove more fruitful.

When adopting a mobile-first strategy, you might encounter something similar to the following.

```jsx
import { css } from "@compiled/react"

const style = css({
   "color": "yellow",
   "@media (min-width: 720px)": { color: "red" },
   "@media (min-width: 1280px)": { color: "green" }
})
```

Both `@media (min-width: 30rem) { color: red }` and `@media (min-width: 64rem) { color: green }` can take affect at once.
As mentioned above, it can cause unexpected behaviors.
Instead, please make sure that only one declaration can take affect at once.

```jsx
import { css } from "@compiled/react"

const style = css({
   "color": "yellow",
   "@media (min-width: 720px) and (max-width: 1279px)": { color: "red" },
   "@media (min-width: 1280px)": { color: "green" }
})
```
