# Atomic CSS

Atomic CSS will reduce the total amount of defined styles by creating a single rule for every style declaration -
resulting in the large majority of your styles being re-used instead of duplicated.

Typically CSS is defined like so:

```css
.button {
  border: none;
  font-size: 14px;
  background-color: purple;
  border-radius: 3px;
}
```

```html
<button className="button">Hello world</button>
```

However when products scale to hundreds of developers,
defined styles can get messy,
and very duplicated.

If we take the same rule and change it to be atomic CSS:

```css
.b-none {
  border: none;
}

.fs-14 {
  font-size: 14px;
}

.bgc-purple {
  background-color: purple;
}

.br-3 {
  border-radius: 3px;
}
```

```html
<button className="b-none fs-14 bgc-purple br-3">Hello world</button>
```

When other components end up defining similar styles,
they end up using the same rules.

```html
<span className="fs-14">Text</span>
```

## Other benefits

There are other benefits over and beyond just re-using CSS rules.

### Overriding through composition

When you can't create CSS at runtime enabling [composition of styles](/composition) can seem impossible.
If nothing was done depending on the order of rendered components you'd get different results.

Using atomic CSS we can encode all the data needed to ensure developers can compose styles together,
without the gotchas of [CSS cascade ordering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance).

Take these two atomic rules:

```css
.color-blue {
  color: blue;
}
.color-red {
  color: red;
}
```

There are two pieces of data that can be used in the class name.

1. The atomic group - in this case `color`
1. The atomic value - in this case `blue` and `red`

Using them we can ensure that only one atomic group can exist in an elements class name.
We introduce a small utility to help with this,
a function called `ax`:

```jsx
<div className={ax(['color-blue', 'color-red'])} />
```

The final result becomes:

```jsx
<div className="color-red" />
```

The last atomic group defined wins.

### Ordered pseudos

When defining pseudo classes atomic CSS imposes some restrictions.
Remember,
only one CSS rule per declaration can exist!

Take these two examples which order `hover` and `active` pseudo classes differently,
but they share the same atomic rule,
what happens?

```jsx
<div
  css={`
    :hover {
      color: blue;
    }
    :active {
      color: red;
    }
  `}
/>
```

```jsx
<div
  css={`
    :active {
      color: red;
    }
    :hover {
      color: blue;
    }
  `}
/>
```

The simple answer is it depends which component renders first!
Which is inconsistent at best,
and just plain wrong at worse.

To ensure we have a stable experience enforcement of a specific ordering of pseudo classes is done using **LVFHA**:

- **L**ink
- **V**isited
- **F**ocus
- **H**over
- **A**ctive

The last defined pseudo wins.
For the list above,
active state would take precedence over hover state.
This ordering ensures a stable,
consistent experience.

## Pitfalls

There are trade-offs for everything.
Atomic CSS while dramatically reducing the total amount of defined CSS,
increases HTML markup from the addition of added classes to elements.

Every CSS declaration will add another class to the element,
scaling linearly,
you can see this on the first example on this page.
However at scale this can prove to be worth it,
with compression techniques like `gzip` working very well at reducing bundle size.

We have some [optimization ideas to investigate](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/335) when we are further through development.
