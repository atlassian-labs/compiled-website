# What is Compiled?

Compiled is a build time [CSS-in-JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-styling.html#what-is-css-in-js) library that has a two-step transformation process,
that outputs [atomic CSS](/atomic-css).

## Pre-calculate styles

Write your styles in JavaScript or TypeScript and Compiled will **create all CSS rules ahead of time** baking everything the component needs to run.

<BeforeHowItWorks />

Becomes:

<AfterHowItWorks />

Resulting in **very performant components** that can be **used without needing bundler configuration**,
like when consuming packages from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

## Extract styles

Turn on the extract plugin and **all pre-calculated CSS** will be **removed from your JavaScript bundle** and moved to a single [atomic style sheet](/atomic-css) (including those from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)).

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { ax } from '@compiled/react/runtime';

export const EmphasisText = React.forwardRef(
  ({ as: C = 'span', style, primary, ...props }, ref) => (
    <C
      {...props}
      style={{ ...style, '--_ogjj5i': primary ? '#00B8D9' : '#36B37E' }}
      ref={ref}
      className={ax(['_syazpjp7 _1p1dangw _k48pni7l', props.className])}
    />
  )
);
```

Resulting in **smaller JavaScript bundles**,
and even **better peformance**.
Extracting will be [shipping in 2021](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/58).
