# Limitations

## Hard limitations

The architecture of Compiled prevents some things that are possible with runtime libraries.

### Runtime CSS

CSS can't be created at runtime which includes dynamic CSS selectors as well.

```jsx
const selectedIndex = useState(0);

<div
  css={{
    // Will not work!
    [`:nth-child(${selectedIndex})`]: {
      display: 'block',
    },
  }}
/>;
```

If the selector resolves to a static constant value it will work.

## Missing behaviour

Some behaviour and features will be implemented in the future.
