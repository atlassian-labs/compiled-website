# Limitations

The architecture of Compiled prevents some things that are possible with runtime libraries.

## Runtime styles

Styles can't be created at runtime which includes dynamic selectors as well.

```jsx
const selectedIndex = useState(0);

<div
  css={{
    // Will not work!
    [`:nth-child(${selectedIndex})`]: {
      display: 'block',
    },
  }}
/>;
```

If a dynamic value resolves to a static constant value however, it will work!

## Missing behavior

Some behavior and features will be implemented in the future.
