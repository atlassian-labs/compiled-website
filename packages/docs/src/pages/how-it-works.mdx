# How It Works

Compiled compiles your CSS in JS at build time by statically analyzing your code and then transforming it into Compiled Components.
Everything we need to use the component is included along side it in the JavaScript bundle.

We take your initial code in all its glory:

```jsx
import { styled } from 'styled-components';

styled.span`
  color: #ff5630;
`;
```

And then transform it into a Compiled Component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { CC, CS } from '@compiled/css-in-js';
export const ColoredText = /*#__PURE__*/ React.forwardRef(
  ({ as: C = 'span', ...props }, ref) => (
    <CC>
      <CS hash="zd46j1">{['.cc-zd46j1{color:#ff5630}']}</CS>
      <C
        {...props}
        ref={ref}
        className={'cc-zd46j1' + (props.className ? ' ' + props.className : '')}
      />
    </CC>
  )
);
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  ColoredText.displayName = 'ColoredText';
}
```

Which then at runtime will move the styles to the head of the document.

This kind of transformation allows us to deliver your component to any consumer,
without needing them to configure/setup their tooling.
Just import and go.
This is powerful,
and more importantly exactly the same as current CSS in JS libraries work -
with one catch.

_CSS can't be generated at runtime._

This single constraint opens a lot of doors for us.
Build time optimizations.
Runtime guarantees.
Performance bottlenecks gone.

While Compiled currently only targets inline Compiled Components,
we'll eventually get to more exciting grounds -
optional CSS extraction.
It'll be super exciting to make work,
come [chime into the RFC](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled-css-in-js/issues/36) if you're interested.
