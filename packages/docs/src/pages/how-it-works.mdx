# How It Works

Compiled compiles your CSS in JS at build time by statically analyzing your code and then transforming it into Compiled Components.
This is different to how other compile time libraries operate -
extracting to CSS is **not the first destination** for Compiled.

But it is the final destination -
more about this soon.

## Authored code

We take your original code in all its glory.

```jsx
import { styled } from 'styled-components';

styled.div`
  font-size: 12px;
`;
```
