# @compiled/webpack-loader

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) loader used to transform your code.
See [Installation](/installation#webpack) for setup instructions.

This package will always be pinned to the same version of the [React package](/pkg-react),
however it will follow semver.

```bash
npm install @compiled/webpack-loader --save-dev
```

## Options

Configure in your Webpack config.

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: [
          { loader: 'babel-loader' },
          {
            loader: '@compiled/webpack-loader',
            options: {
              importReact: true,
              nonce: '__webpack_nonce__',
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

#### importReact: boolean

Will import React into the module if it is not found.
When using `@babel/preset-react` with the [automatic runtime](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react#react-automatic-runtime) this is not needed and can be set to `false`.

Defaults to `true`.

#### nonce: string

Enables CSP support,
read [Security](/security) for more information.
