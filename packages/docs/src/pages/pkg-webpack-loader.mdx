# @compiled/webpack-loader

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) loader used to transform your code.
See [installation](/installation#webpack) for setup instructions.

```bash
npm install @compiled/webpack-loader --save-dev
```

## Options

Configure in your Webpack config.

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: [
          { loader: 'babel-loader' },
          {
            loader: '@compiled/webpack-loader',
            options: {
              importReact: true,
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### importReact: boolean

Will import React into the module if it is not found.
When using `@babel/preset-react` with the [automatic runtime](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react#react-automatic-runtime) this is not needed and can be set to `false`.

Defaults to `true`.

### extract: boolean

Enables extracting all styles to an atomic style sheet,
to be used in conjunction with `CompiledExtractPlugin`.
Read the [Webpack CSS extraction](/css-extraction-webpack) guide for help.

Defaults to `false`.

### bake: boolean

Enables baking your styles into JavaScript.

Defaults to `true`.

## CompiledExtractPlugin

Plugin to be used when the `extract` option is set to `true`.

```js
// webpack.config.js
const { CompiledExtractPlugin } = require('@compiled/webpack-loader');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [new CompiledExtractPlugin()],
};
```

### nodeModulesTest: Condition

As a performance optimization you can test paths to include by [passing a webpack condition](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#condition) to the plugin.

```js
new CompiledExtractPlugin({
  nodeModulesTest: /@atlaskit/,
});
```

### nodeModulesInclude: Condition

As a performance optimization you can include paths by [passing a webpack condition](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#condition) to the plugin.

```js
new CompiledExtractPlugin({
  nodeModulesInclude: [require.resolve('@atlaskit/button')],
});
```

### nodeModulesExclude: Condition

As a performance optimization you can exclude paths by [passing a webpack condition](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#condition) to the plugin.

```js
new CompiledExtractPlugin({
  nodeModulesExclude: [require.resolve('@atlaskit/button')],
});
```
