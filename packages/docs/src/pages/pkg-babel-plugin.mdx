# @compiled/babel-plugin

Babel plugin used to transform your code.
See [Installation](/installation#babel) for setup instructions.

This package will always be pinned to the same version of the [React package](/pkg-react),
however it will follow semver.

```bash
npm install @compiled/babel-plugin --save-dev
```

## Options

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "@compiled/babel-plugin",
      {
        "importReact": true,
        "nonce": "__webpack_nonce__"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

#### importReact: boolean

Will import React into the module if it is not found.
When using `@babel/preset-react` with the [automatic runtime](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react#react-automatic-runtime) this is not needed and you can set this to `false`.

Defaults to `true`.

#### nonce: string

Enables CSP support,
read [Security](/security) for more information.

#### cache: boolean | 'single-pass'

Will cache the result of statically evaluated imports.
Defaults to `true`.

- `true` will cache for the duration of the node process
- `'single-pass'` will cache for a single pass of a file
- `false` turns caching off
