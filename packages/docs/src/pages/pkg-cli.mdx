# @compiled/cli

Command-line interface utilities.
This package does not follow semver and will always be pinned to the same version of the [React package](/pkg-react).

We suggest running this package through [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npx),
where `@latest` is the version of `@compiled/react` you've installed.

```bash
npx @compiled/cli@latest
```

Then follow the prompts.

## Presets

The CLI comes with presets to streamline usage.

### Codemods

```bash
npx @compiled/cli --preset codemods
```

#### Emotion to Compiled

Will convert all usages of Emotion to Compiled.
For code that could not be automatically converted a `/** TODO(@compiled/react codemod):` comment will be placed.

#### Styled components to Compiled

Will convert all usages of Styled Components to Compiled.
For code that could not be automatically converted a `/** TODO(@compiled/react codemod):` comment will be placed.
