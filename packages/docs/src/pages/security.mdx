Compiled supports this using the `nonce` option,
where `nonce` is some identifier for your bundler to replace.
If you're using Webpack they [handle nonce quite easily too](https://webpack.js.org/guides/csp/).
The main principle is `nonce` should resolve to a **unique** secret that the server generates **every page load**!

You can enable it in both Babel and the TypeScript transformer,
these examples using what Webpack would want.

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    ["@compiled/babel-plugin-css-in-js", { "nonce": "__webpack_nonce__" }]
  ]
}
```

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": [
      {
        "transform": "@compiled/ts-transform-css-in-js",
        "options": {
          "nonce": "__webpack_nonce_"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

When setting Compiled with a `nonce` we then use it to declare our `style` elements.
Let's say `__webpack_nonce__` gets transformed to a secret method at build time which will return the `nonce`.

```diff
-__webpack_nonce__
+uniqueNonceOncePerServerLoad() // returns "k0Mp1lEd" this run
```

And then on the server we ensure that a `meta` tag is set using this value:

```html
<meta
  http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
  content=" object-src 'none'; style-src 'nonce-k0Mp1lEd' <--- nonce used here
'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' 'strict-dynamic' https: http:; base-uri 'none';"
/>
```

And finally our Compiled Component renders:

```jsx
<style nonce="k0Mp1lEd">.cc-1234 { color: red; }</style>
<div class="cc-1234">hello world</div>
```

Success!
The browser allowed our styles to be used.

But if our nonce did not match,
or were just missing...

```jsx
<style>.cc-1234 { color: red; }</style>
<div class="cc-1234">hello world</div>
```

Oh no!
The browser blocks them from being used and logs an error to the console.

## User input

Because of the static nature of Compiled,
we can't re-generate CSS at runtime which means as a developer you're now just a little bit safer.
If you take user input and use it to do dynamic styling it's also pumped through React,
so you get their sanitization for free.

All this to say -
you probably don't have to worry about much.

But make sure you sanitize user inputs regardless,
especially on the server.
