# Security

## Content security policy

A [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) allows us to be explicit about what can and can't run in web apps -
JavaScript,
styles,
images even.

Supporting a CSP works by setting `nonce` in the Babel plugin config,
where `nonce` is an identifier your bundler can replace at build time.
If you're bundling with Webpack they [have support for this](https://webpack.js.org/guides/csp/).
A `nonce` should resolve to a _unique_ secret that the server generates _every page load_.

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "@compiled/core/babel-plugin",
      {
        "nonce": "__webpack_nonce__"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here `__webpack_nonce__` gets transformed to a function at build time which will return a unique `nonce` every invocation.

```diff
-__webpack_nonce__
+uniqueNonceOncePerServerLoad() // returns "k0Mp1lEd" this run
```

On the server we need ensure that a `meta` tag in the `head` is set using the same value:

```html
<meta
  http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
  content="object-src 'none'; style-src 'nonce-k0Mp1lEd' <--- nonce used here
'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' 'strict-dynamic' https: http:; base-uri 'none';"
/>
```

Finally when rendering a component on the client...

```jsx
<style nonce="k0Mp1lEd">._syaz1mor { color: red; }</style>
<div class="_syaz1mor">hello world</div>
```

Success!
The browser allowed styles to be used.
However if the nonce did not match or was missing:

```jsx
<style>._syaz1mor { color: red; }</style>
<div class="_syaz1mor">hello world</div>
```

Uh oh,
the browser blocks them from being used and logs an error to the console.

## User input

Because of the static nature of Compiled,
creating CSS at runtime is not possible which means as developers we're now just a little bit safer.
If we take user input and use it to do dynamic styling it's also pumped through React,
we get their sanitization for free.

All this to say -
we don't have to worry about much.
But make sure to sanitize user inputs regardless,
especially on the server.
