# Server Side Rendering

Server side rendering (SSR) in Compiled works by compiling the CSS next to the element itself.
This is very similar to how Emotion accomplishes it by default.

This strategy has a few benefits -
the biggest being when rendering React on the server with the [streaming API](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html#rendertonodestream) your component styles are streamed together with your component markup,
resulting in things being rendered to users faster.

```jsx
import { renderToNodeStream } from 'react-dom/server';
import { App } from '@app/code';

renderToNodeStream(<App />);
```

> **Warning** - This approach can interfere with nth child and similar selectors as it is inserts style tags directly into your markup.
> We have an [RFC where we are thinking about what to do with this](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled-css-in-js/issues/31) - please join the conversation!

## Selector workarounds

So you've seen the error message in dev and you're supporting SSR so you can't let this message go.
Let's go into a few _workarounds_.

### First child

Luckily this one is easy.
Let's say you're targetting the `:first-child` child.

```jsx
<div css={`
  > :first-child {
    color: red;
  }
`}>
  <div /> <-- text will be red, after JavaScript executes
  <div />
</div>
```

But the text isn't red before the JavaScript has executed!
What can we do?

Use a different selector.

```jsx
<div css={`
  > [data-first-child] {
    color: red;
  }
`}>
  <div data-first-child /> <-- text will be red, always
  <div />
</div>
```

Right now this is really the only sure fire way of getting what we want.

## Nth-child

This also applies to `:nth-child` as well,
where `style` elements can appear and ruin our day before JavaScript has executed.

```jsx
<div css={`
  > :nth-child(even) {
    color: red;
  }

  > :nth-child(odd) {
    color: blue;
  }
`}>
  <div /> <-- text will be red, after JavaScript executes
  <div /> <-- text will be blue, after JavaScript executes
</div>
```

```jsx
<div css={`
  > [data-even] {
    color: red;
  }

  > [data-odd] {
    color: blue;
  }
`}>
  <div data-even /> <-- text will be red, always
  <div data-odd /> <-- text will be blue, always
</div>
```
