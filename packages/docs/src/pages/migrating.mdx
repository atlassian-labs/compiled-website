# Migrating to Compiled

Follow the [installation](/installation) instructions before continuing.

## Styled Components

Replace the imports with `@compiled/react`.

```diff
-import styled from 'styled-components';
+import { styled } from '@compiled/react';

styled.div`
  font-size: 12px;
  color: ${props => props.color};
`;
```

There exists a [codemod](/docs/pkg-cli#styled-components-to-compiled) to streamline this.

## Emotion

Replace the imports with `@compiled/react`.

```diff
-/** @jsx jsx */
-import { jsx } from '@emotion/core';
+import '@compiled/react';

(props) => (
  <div
    css={{
      color: 'red',
      backgroundColor: props.background,
    }}
  />
)
```

```diff
-import styled from '@emotion/styled';
+import { styled } from '@compiled/react';

styled.div`
  font-size: 12px;
  color: ${props => props.color};
`;
```

There exists a [codemod](/docs/pkg-cli#emotion-to-compiled) to streamline this.

## Current limitations

### Missing APIs

There is work planned to flesh out the remainder APIs.

- [Global component](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/62)
- [Animation keyframes](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/14)
