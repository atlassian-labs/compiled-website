# Installation

There are two avenues we can take to enable Compiled either with the TypeScript compiler or with Babel.
Both end up using the same transformations under-the-hood.

We start by installing the library made for React -
this will give us all the APIs we know and love.

```bash
npm install @compiled/css-in-js
```

> **Note** - It won't work without enabling a transform and will just throw an exception.
> This is because there [isn't any code there to run](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/blob/master/packages/core/src/styled/index.tsx#L63) ðŸ˜Ž.

## Babel

We need to install the dependency and then wire up the plugin in your `.babelrc` config.
Make sure the Compiled plugin is the **first plugin in the array**.
Need a live example?
[These docs you're reading are built using
the Babel plugin!](https://github.com/compiled/website/tree/master/packages/docs)

```bash
npm install @compiled/babel-plugin-css-in-js
```

```jsx
{
  "plugins": ["@compiled/babel-plugin-css-in-js"]
}
```

## TypeScript compiler

This is a little bit more cumbersome to setup because there isn't any official support for defining plugins in your `tsconfig.json`.
But it still works great!
Need a live example?
[The introduction is built using
the TypeScript transformer](https://github.com/compiled/website/tree/master/packages/introduction).

```bash
npm install @compiled/ts-transform-css-in-js ttypescript
```

```jsx
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": [{ "transform": "@compiled/ts-transform-css-in-js" }]
  }
}
```

Now it's a matter of getting the compiler to pick up plugins from your `tsconfig.json`.

### TypeScript CLI

Run `ttsc` instead of `tsc`.

```diff
-tsc
+ttsc
```

### Webpack

Set the compiler option to `ttypescript`.

```jsx
{
  loader: require.resolve('ts-loader'),
  options: {
    compiler: 'ttypescript',
  },
},
```

### Parcel

Install the plugin and we're done!

```bash
npm i parcel-plugin-ttypescript
```
