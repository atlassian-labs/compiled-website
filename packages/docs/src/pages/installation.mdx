# Installation

Setup is required.
Install the [React](https://reactjs.org) package with `npm` or `yarn`.

```bash
npm install @compiled/react
```

Compiled uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io) to transform your code,
so you'll need to use either [its CLI](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-cli) or your bundler of choice.

## Babel setup

Add the plugin in your [Babel config](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/configuration).

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@compiled/react/babel-plugin"]
}
```

> **Note** <br /> For extra configuration [look at the plugin package documentation](/pkg-babel-plugin).
