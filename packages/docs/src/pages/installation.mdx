# Installation

Setup is required.
Install the [React](https://reactjs.org) package with `npm` or `yarn`.

```bash
npm install @compiled/react
```

Then configure your bundler of choice or use [Babel](https://babeljs.io) directly.

## Webpack

Install the [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) loader.

```bash
npm install @compiled/webpack-loader --save-dev
```

Add the loader to your [Webpack config](https://webpack.js.org/).
Make sure this is defined after other loaders so it runs first.

```js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: '@compiled/webpack-loader',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

See the [loader package docs](/pkg-webpack-loader) for more information.

## Babel

Install the [Babel](https://babeljs.io) plugin.

```bash
npm install @compiled/babel-plugin --save-dev
```

Add the plugin to your [Babel config](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/configuration).
Make sure this is defined after other plugins so it runs first.

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@compiled/babel-plugin"]
}
```

See the [plugin package docs](/pkg-babel-plugin) for more information.
