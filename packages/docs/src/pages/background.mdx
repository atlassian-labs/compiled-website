# Background

For us CSS in JS solutions have provided a fantastic developer experience,
deep integrations with JavaScript by design,
and the delivery mechanism of said libraries make it super easy for consumers to consume our components.
Just import and use them -
and you're good to go!

But at the same time we've seen scaling problems.
Unintended performance issues.
Death by a thousand cuts.

If we could re-imagine CSS in JS - what would it look like?

- Performant styling with no footguns
- Hassle free dynamic styling at runtime
- Zero re-renders when theme changes
- Extensible for more advanced optimization later in time

And what could it look like for consumers of our components?

- Zero config to get started
- Zero config for server-side rendering
- Impossible to have multiple versions of the library clash against each other
- No impact on bundle size
- Opt-into some setup for bigger performance wins

This is the benchmark for which Compiled is being written against,
with the added constraint of not costing much to migrate to.
