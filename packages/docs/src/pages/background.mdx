# Background

For us CSS in JS solutions has provided a fantastic developer experience,
deep integrations with JavaScript by design,
and the delivery mechanism of said libraries make it super easy for consumers to consume our components.
Just import and use them -
and you're good to go!

But at the same time we've seen scaling problems.
Unintended performance issues.
Death by a thousand cuts.

If we could re-imagine CSS in JS - what would it look like?

- Not need any upfront configuration for our consumers
- Not need any configuration for server-side rendering
- Be impossible to have unperformant styling
- Be extensible for more advanced optimization
- Zero re-renders when theme changes
- Minimal to no runtime
- Be impossible to have multiple versions of the library clash

This is the benchmark for which Compiled is being written against,
with the extra constraint of not costing too much to migrate to.
