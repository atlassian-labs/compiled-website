# @compiled/parcel-transformer

[Parcel v2](https://v2.parceljs.org) transformer used to transform your code.
See [Installation](/installation#parcel) for setup instructions.

This package will always be pinned to the same version of the [React package](/pkg-react),
however it will follow semver.

```bash
npm install @compiled/parcel-transformer --save-dev
```

> **Note** <br /> Parcel v2 is currently in pre-release which makes this transformer experimental,
> it may break when updating Parcel.
> Use with caution.
