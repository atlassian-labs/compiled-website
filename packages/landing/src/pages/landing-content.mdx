## Write your styles in JavaScript

Using APIs you may already be familiar with,
write your styles in JavaScript with the full power of CSS —
leveraging the language to create expressive & dynamic experiences.

```jsx
import '@compiled/react';

export const LargeHotPinkText = ({ children }) => (
  <span
    css={{
      color: 'hotpink',
      fontSize: 48,
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);
```

## Speed up your CSS-in-JS

[Configure Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files) and build your components using its [CLI](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-cli) or your bundler of choice,
resulting in a **very performant component** that has its styles built ahead of time.

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@compiled/react/babel-plugin"]
}
```

```bash
$ babel src
Successfully compiled 1 file with Babel (9ms)
```

```jsx
import { CC, CS } from '@compiled/react/runtime';

const _2 = '._syaz1q9v{color: hotpink}';
const _ = '._1wybfyhu{font-size: 48px;}';

export const LargeHotPinkText = ({ children }) => (
  <CC>
    <CS>{[_, _2]}</CS>
    <span className="_syaz1q9v _1wybfyhu">{children}</span>
  </CC>
);
```

## Extract all styles to CSS

Turn on the bundler plugin and all components styled with Compiled in your app or sourced through [NPM](https://npmjs.com/) will have their styles extracted to a single [atomic style sheet](./docs/atomic-css).

1. Build your app

```bash
$ parcel build
✨  Built in 0.83s.
```

2. An atomic style sheet is generated

```css
._1wybfyhu {
  font-size: 48px;
}
._syaz1q9v {
  color: hotpink;
}
```

3. All style rules and runtime components are removed from your bundle

```jsx
export const LargeHotPinkText = ({ children }) => (
  <span className="_syaz1q9v _1wybfyhu">{children}</span>
);
```

We are bringing styles from platform,
product,
and the wider ecosystem closer.
It's time to extract all styles!
Extracting will be [shipping in 2021](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/58).
