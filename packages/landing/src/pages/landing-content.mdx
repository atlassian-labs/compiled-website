import '@compiled/react';
import { ExampleContainer, ExampleRoot } from '@compiled/website-ui';
import { LargeHotPinkText } from '../components/example';

## Better for component authors

Write your styles in JavaScript/TypeScript with the full power of CSS,
leveraging the language to create expressive & dynamic experiences.

```jsx
import '@compiled/react';

export const LargeHotPinkText = ({ children }) => (
  <span
    css={{
      color: 'hotpink',
      fontSize: 48,
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);
```

[Configure Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files) and build your components using its [CLI](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-cli) or your bundler of choice.

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@compiled/react/babel-plugin"]
}
```

```bash
$ babel src
Successfully compiled 1 file with Babel (9ms)
```

```jsx
import { CC, CS } from '@compiled/react/runtime';

const _2 = '._syaz1q9v{color: hotpink}';
const _ = '._1wybfyhu{font-size: 48px;}';

export const LargeHotPinkText = ({ children }) => (
  <CC>
    <CS>{[_, _2]}</CS>
    <span className="_syaz1q9v _1wybfyhu">{children}</span>
  </CC>
);
```

You now have a **super fast component** that has all of its styles built ahead of time.

## Better for consumers

Components published to [NPM](https://npmjs.com/) or defined in your app built with Compiled always render exactly as authored on both the server and client.
No complicated configuration needed.

```jsx
import { LargeHotPinkText } from '@text/components';

<LargeHotPinkText>Hello world</LargeHotPinkText>;
```

<ExampleRoot>
  <ExampleContainer css={{ padding: '1.5rem' }}>
    <LargeHotPinkText>Hello world</LargeHotPinkText>
  </ExampleContainer>
</ExampleRoot>

## Better for the web

Turn on the bundler plugin and all components styled with Compiled in your app or sourced through [NPM](https://npmjs.com/) will have their styles extracted to a single [atomic style sheet](./docs/atomic-css).

1. Build your app

```bash
$ parcel build
âœ¨  Built in 0.83s.
```

2. An atomic style sheet is generated

```css
._1wybfyhu {
  font-size: 48px;
}
._syaz1q9v {
  color: hotpink;
}
```

3. All style rules and runtime components are removed from your bundle

```jsx
export const LargeHotPinkText = ({ children }) => (
  <span className="_syaz1q9v _1wybfyhu">{children}</span>
);
```

> **Tip** - If you're publishing a component library or design system it's recommended not to extract _yet_.
> For the best results extract in apps only.

Let's start thinking not just about one web app,
but the entire ecosystem and all packages we consume.
It's time to bring platform and product closer and extract all styles!

Extracting will be [shipping in 2021](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/58).
